Hell 2 Modding is a modding plugin / framework for Hades II.

It's using [ReturnOfModding](https://github.com/xiaoxiao921/ReturnOfModdingBase) as a base. You can check its README for more information on how it works.

## Mod Manager Installation

- Until ReturnOfModding integration is merged into the main r2modman version, [use the fork available here.](https://github.com/xiaoxiao921/r2modmanPlus/releases/)

## Manual Installation

- Place the main Hell2Modding file, called `d3d12.dll`, next to the game executable called `Hades2.exe` in the game's `Ship` folder.

- To uninstall the mod loader or revert to a vanilla experience without mods, you can simply rename or delete the `d3d12.dll` file.
